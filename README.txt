## README

### Project Completion Confirmation

Dear Team,

I am writing this README file to confirm that I have completed the project as discussed during the interview session. I want to acknowledge that while I have limited experience with pipelines, I have made the efforts to include relevant information about the text-to-image aspect in the project.

### Instructions

1. **Running the Project:**
   - Please run the `main.py` file to initiate the project.
  
2. **Viewing the Output:**
   - After running the `main.py` file, open `gword.htm` to view the results.

### Project Scope

I would like to emphasize that this project serves as a demonstration of my capabilities in Python programming. Although my focus was on the text-to-image part, I want to highlight that I am proficient in using Python libraries like Pandas and can approach problem-solving from various perspectives.

###P.S:

I have included some samples too. Also the cloud Code credit goes to: https://www.py4e.com/

### Conclusion

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skills through this project. I appreciate your time and consideration.
